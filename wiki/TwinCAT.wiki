= TwinCAT ST (Structured Text) Language =

The structured text consists of a series of instructions which, as determined in high level languages, ("IF..THEN..ELSE") or in loops (WHILE..DO) can be executed.

== Expressions ==

Construction returning a value after its evaluation.
Composed of *operators* and *operands*.
An *operand* can be:
  * A constant
  * A variable
  * A Function Call
  * An Expression

{{{
expression = ( constant | variable | functioncall ),
             ( constant | variable | functioncall ) operator expression;
}}}

Binding strength in expressions:
  # Parentheses `(expression)`
  # Function call `Function name (parameter list)`
  # Exponentiation `EXPT`
  # Negate `NOT`
  # Multiply,Divide,Modulo `*,/,MOD`
  # Add,Subtract `+,-`
  # Compare `<,>,<=,>=`
  # Equal to,Not Equal to  `=,<>`
  # Boolean AND `AND`
  # Boolean XOR `XOR`
  # Boolean OR `OR`
